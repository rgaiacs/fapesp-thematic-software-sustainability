Research Reproducibility in Brazil
==================================

We are living in the era of research reproducibility crisis [1]. 
Increasingly research that could be reproducible cannot be reproduced due 
to obstacles which could be avoided such as: lack of basic
computational lab skills, not pulblishing data and source code
used and so on.

The reproducibility issue is present in the international 
research arena. A growing number of countries focus addressing it.

This project will investigate the reproducibility in  Brazilian research 
accorss domains and projects. In particular we will focus on the
following three problems:

1. data management and distribution;
2. automatation and version control; and
3. computational environment replication.

At the end of the project we will have answered
the following questions

1. Why researchers doesn't share their data?
2. Why researchers doesn't share their computational workflow?
3. Why researchers doesn't use cloud environment?
4. How can we help researchers share their data more often?
5. How can we help researchers share their computational workflow more often?
6. How can we help researchers use cloud enviroments more often?

In adition,
we will train some researchers in better practices.

Data Management
---------------

We will investigate how researchers manage their spreadsheets and data bases.

Automatation
------------

We will investigate how research automate or program the steps they repeat
at their research.
As a side investigation,
we will look of what tools researchers use to version control their work.

Computational Environment
-------------------------

Differences at the computational environment
such as number crunch library version
that could be look minor
ends being a big barrier for reproducibility.
In the last 10 years,
software industry is using containers
to solve a similar issue they had
and in the last 2 years
some researchers are experimenting with those tools
to make their research more reprodutible.
