Research Reproducibility in Brazil
==================================

As reported in some journals,
we are living an research reproducibility crises
when most of the research that could be reproducible
by peers isn't because some computational assets,
such as data and source code used,
aren't available.

This project will investigate the reproducible status
of Brazilian research in diferent domains
and focus in three part of the reproducible problem
named

1. data management and distribution;
2. automatation and version control; and
3. computational environment replication.

At the end of the project we will have answered
the following questions

1. Why researchers doesn't share their data?
2. Why researchers doesn't share their computational workflow?
3. Why researchers doesn't use cloud environment?
4. How can we help researchers share their data more often?
5. How can we help researchers share their computational workflow more often?
6. How can we help researchers use cloud enviroments more often?

In adition,
we will train some researchers in better practices.

Data Management
---------------

We will investigate how researchers manage their spreadsheets and data bases.

Automatation
------------

We will investigate how research automate or program the steps they repeat
at their research.
As a side investigation,
we will look of what tools researchers use to version control their work.

Computational Environment
-------------------------

Differences at the computational environment
such as number crunch library version
that could be look minor
ends being a big barrier for reproducibility.
In the last 10 years,
software industry is using containers
to solve a similar issue they had
and in the last 2 years
some researchers are experimenting with those tools
to make their research more reprodutible.
